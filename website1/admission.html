                <h2 class="card-title">Course Necessity:</h2>
                <p class="card-text">The main mantra to do well in the HSC exam is to understand the concept and solve creative problems as much as possible. Students spend a lot of time solving theoretical, conceptual, mathematical problems, and recalling formulas. Solving any board exam and test paper is complementary to each other. In preparation for the final swing of the Intermediate, solving test papers is essential. In that perspective, I hope this course will work like a positive influencer for the preparation of HSC examinees.</p>
